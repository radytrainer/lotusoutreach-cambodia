        "A pivotal moment came when Khyentse Norbu visited Cambodia for the first time and met a young girl at a safe house orphanage—a moment that shaped the organization’s long-term commitment to the country: “This particular girl held my finger–and she wouldn’t let me go. But so tight; really, really tight. She wouldn’t let me go. I had this really strong feeling, connection, so to speak. So I immediately asked the orphanage, I really want to support this girl, you know, all the way through her university and on. She was also a little bit blind. So, I have to really give credit to her strength to have Lotus Outreach here today. It is really because of her.”",
